      "During my internship at CODSOFT, I had the opportunity to work remotely and gain hands-on experience in web development. I collaborated with the development team to create and enhance web applications, focusing on front-end and back-end development tasks. My responsibilities included implementing new features, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing website performance. Throughout the internship, I deepened my understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, react.js, node.js and mongoDB  and gained practical experience with frameworks and libraries. Additionally, I learned to effectively communicate and collaborate in a virtual work environment, demonstrating adaptability and teamwork.",
